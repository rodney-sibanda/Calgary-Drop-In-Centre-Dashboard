# Enhanced Inventory Management Dashboard for the Calgary Drop-In Centre

# About this Project

In collaboration with the Calgary Drop-In Centre, Myself and my team embarked on a transformative project to optimize inventory management and resource allocation. The Donation Centre's role as a hub for supplying essential items to various programs and partners underscored the urgency to enhance donation tracking, analysis, and visualization. The goal was clear: create a robust dashboard that provides real-time insights, empowers data-driven decisions, and maximizes the impact of every resource.

# Problem Statement

The existing inventory management system posed challenges in accurately tracking incoming and outgoing donations. These discrepancies hindered efficient distribution and the ability to forecast shortages of critical supplies. Our objective was to bridge this gap by developing a sophisticated dashboard that not only addressed current limitations but also provided an intuitive tool for the team to optimize operations.

# Key Features
 ## Homepage
 The homepage serves as the initial gateway into the dashboard's insights. Through a compact snapshot of inventory value and status, it provides an immediate assessment of the resources at hand. This feature empowers quick decision-making by highlighting any unusual trends or areas requiring attention, ensuring that your team can respond promptly to fluctuations in inventory

 ## Executive Summary
 The executive summary tab offers a holistic overview of the inventory ecosystem. It presents a detailed analysis of inventory status, trends over time, and a direct comparison between incoming and outgoing donations. This comprehensive insight equips decision-makers with the tools they need to optimize resource allocation, enabling a more informed distribution strategy that is responsive to dynamic demands.
 
 ## Item Availability
 The item availability tab takes a deep dive into each item stored in the warehouse. By classifying items as at stock, overstock, understock, or out of stock, it provides an intuitive representation of their status. The forecast functionality goes beyond static data, offering valuable predictions for when items might run out of stock and expected stock positions for the next 30 days. This predictive power enables proactive planning and minimizes disruptions caused by shortages.
 
 ## Stock Coverage
 The stock coverage tab introduces a sophisticated class system that assigns codes to each item, organizing them into an engaging heatmap-style display. Incorporating the ABC-XYZ analysis algorithm enriches this visualization further, enabling a nuanced categorization of products based on consumption volume and predictability. This dynamic approach aids in pinpointing critical items that require special attention and those that can be managed with standard practices.
 
 ## Item Deep Dive
 The item deep tab grants users a granular view of specific items, offering a detailed insight into their journey through the Donation Centre. Quantities on hand, inflow, and outflow over specific time frames provide a comprehensive understanding of an item's movement. This is especially significant in the context of resource management. What truly sets this tab apart is the section addressing replenishment strategies. This empowers not only experienced staff but also volunteers and newcomers to sustain operations, fostering a sense of autonomy and continuity.
 
 ## Program Impact 
 The final tab functions as a compelling tool for stakeholder engagement. It visually depicts the allocation of resources to different programs, demonstrating the real-world impact of the Drop-In Centre's operations. This transparency enhances stakeholder trust and engagement. Moreover, it highlights the amount of square footage each item occupies in the warehouse and quantifies the individuals benefited from each program, creating a powerful narrative around the Centre's initiatives
